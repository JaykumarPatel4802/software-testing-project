Problem:

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Examples:

Example 1:
![alt text](imgs/11.1.png)
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Complete the following function with the solution.
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:

Your job is to come up with a correct solution. Optimize the solution such that it has the fast runtime possible for that problem. Write syntatically correct code for Python 3.0 that can run without any runtime errors and solves the problem at hand. Make sure to pay attention to the types of the inputs to the functions, and the type of the output of the function.
