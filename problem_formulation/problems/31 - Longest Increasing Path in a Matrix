Problem:

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1

Complete the following function with the solution.
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:

Your job is to come up with a correct solution. Optimize the solution such that it has the fast runtime possible for that problem. Write syntatically correct code for Python 3.0 that can run without any runtime errors and solves the problem at hand. Make sure to pay attention to the types of the inputs to the functions, and the type of the output of the function.
