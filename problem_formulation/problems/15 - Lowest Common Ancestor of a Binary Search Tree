Problem:

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Examples:

Example 1:
 
      6
    /   \
   2     8
  / \   / \
 0   4 7   9
    / \
   3   5 

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
 
      6
    /   \
   2     8
  / \   / \
 0   4 7   9
    / \
   3   5 

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2

Complete the following function with the solution.

"""Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
         self.val = val
         self.left = left
         self.right = right
"""
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':

Your job is to come up with a correct solution. Optimize the solution such that it has the fast runtime possible for that problem. Write syntatically correct code for Python 3.0 that can run without any runtime errors and solves the problem at hand. Make sure to pay attention to the types of the inputs to the functions, and the type of the output of the function.
