Problem:

You are given a list of integers called heights, where each integer represents the height of a vertical line at that position. The x-axis and any two of these lines can form a container.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,3,4,5,16,17,6]
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum water is held between the lines at index 2 and index 6, forming an area of 16.

Your job is to come up with a correct solution. Optimize the solution such that it has the fast runtime possible for that problem. Write syntatically correct code for Python 3.0 that can run without any runtime errors and solves the problem at hand. Make sure to pay attention to the types of the inputs to the functions, and the type of the output of the function.
